<h2>Feel free to use the code as a basis for your own python discord bot. However it was made in 2019, so I have no if the code will still work.</h2>
<h1> SimplePythonRoleManagmentBot </h1>
A simple role managment bot I made for a friend's server back in 2019. It was hosted on heroku for a few months before I took it down since the server became inactive.
<h2>Users can</h2>
<p>Check their roles with !my roles</p>
<p>Add a role with !add [role_name]</p>
<p>Remove a role with !remove [role_name]</p>
<p>Check all available roles with !all roles</p>
<p>Display a help message with !help</p>
<h2>The bot</h2>
<p>Doesn't use a pre-defined list of roles, it instead iterates over server's roles</p>
<p>Checks if a role user tries to add/remove exists</p>
<p>Checks if a role user tries to add isn't already given to him</p>
<p>Checks if a role user tries to remove is even given to him</p>
<p>Checks if a user has permission for the role</p>
<p>Has a predefined list of roles users can't get with the bot</p<
